# Seq2Seq_Upgrade_TensorFlow
Additional Sequence to Sequence Features for TensorFlow


Hey Guys, TensorFlow is great, but as research in Seq2Seq progresses, I wanted to ensure that we all had access to the latest papers.

That's why I created this additional python package. This is meant to work in conjunction with TensorFlow. Simply clone this and import as:

`import Seq2Seq_Upgrade_TensorFlow as ssu`


Main Features Include:

1. Averaging Hidden States During Decoding
2. Curriculum Learning (Still In Progress)
3. Temperature Integration

Lastly, I'm still have much to learn, so I apologize for mistakes in advance. I welcome pull requests and any help.
